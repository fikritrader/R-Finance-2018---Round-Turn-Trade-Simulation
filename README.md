Repo for storing R/Finance 2018 Presentation RMarkdown for replication purposes, and the knitted HTML output

The Rmd file will let you replicate my analysis and talk materials, whilst the HTML is a knitted output of the Rmd.

The R/Finance 2018 conference was a great experience and i will be back. If you didnt make it or could not catch the livestream, you can see the program details with talk presentations at http://www.rinfinance.com/RinFinance2018/.
